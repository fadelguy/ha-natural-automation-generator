After setup, you can configure:

- **Model**: Choose which AI model to use
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length (100-4000)
- **Temperature**: Response creativity (0.0-1.0, lower = more deterministic)

## Usage

### Service Calls

The integration provides three services:

#### `natural_automation_generator.create_automation`

Create and save an automation from a natural language description.

```yaml
service: natural_automation_generator.create_automation
data:
  description: "Turn on the bathroom light every day at midnight for 10 minutes"
  automation_name: "Bathroom Night Light" # Optional
  preview_only: false # Optional, default: false
```

#### `natural_automation_generator.preview_automation`

Preview an automation without saving it.

```yaml
service: natural_automation_generator.preview_automation
data:
  description: "Turn off all lights when I leave home"
```

#### `natural_automation_generator.list_entities`

List all available entities and areas for reference.

```yaml
service: natural_automation_generator.list_entities
```

### Example Descriptions

Here are some example natural language descriptions you can use:

- **Time-based**: "Turn on the living room lights every weekday at 7 AM"
- **Motion detection**: "Turn on the hallway light when motion is detected at night"
- **Weather-based**: "Close the blinds when it's sunny outside"
- **Device states**: "Send a notification when the washing machine finishes"
- **Complex scenarios**: "If it's after sunset and someone opens the front door, turn on the porch light for 5 minutes"

### Events

The integration fires events for automation results:

- `natural_automation_generator_automation_generated`: Fired when an automation is created
- `natural_automation_generator_automation_previewed`: Fired when an automation is previewed
- `natural_automation_generator_entities_listed`: Fired when entities are listed

### Automation Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Time-Based Automation

**Input**: "Turn on kitchen lights at 6 AM every weekday"

**Generated YAML**:

```yaml
alias: "Turn on kitchen lights at 6 AM every weekday"
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "06:00:00"
condition:
  - condition: time
    weekday:
      - mon
      - tue
      - wed
      - thu
      - fri
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.kitchen
```

#### Example 2: Motion-Based Automation

**Input**: "Turn on bathroom light when motion detected, but only at night"

**Generated YAML**:

```yaml
alias: "Turn on bathroom light when motion detected at night"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.bathroom_motion
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
condition:
  - condition: sun
    after: sunset
  - condition: sun
    before: sunrise
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.bathroom
```

## API Keys and Costs

### OpenAI

- Sign up at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Pricing varies by model (GPT-4o is recommended)
- Typical cost: $0.01-0.05 per automation generation

### Google Gemini

- Sign up at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
- Generous free tier available
- Gemini 1.5 Flash is recommended for cost-effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No Natural Automation Generator configured"**

   - Ensure the integration is properly set up in the Integrations page
   - Check that your API key is valid

2. **"Generation failed"**

   - Check your API key and quota
   - Ensure your description is clear and specific
   - Try a simpler description first

3. **Invalid YAML Generated**

   - The AI occasionally generates invalid YAML
   - Try rephrasing your request
   - Use more specific entity names

4. **Entity not found**
   - Use the `list_entities` service to see available entities
   - Make sure entity names in your description match actual entities

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by adding this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.natural_automation_generator: debug
```
