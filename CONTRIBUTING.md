## Development Tips

### Adding New LLM Providers

1. Create a new provider class inheriting from `BaseLLMProvider`
2. Implement all abstract methods
3. Add the provider to the configuration flow
4. Update constants and documentation
5. Add tests for the new provider

### Improving the System Prompt

The system prompt is crucial for good results. When modifying:

1. Test with various entity types and scenarios
2. Keep the prompt concise but informative
3. Include clear examples
4. Validate that generated YAML is always valid

### Testing with Real APIs

When testing with real API keys:

1. Use test/development API keys
2. Be mindful of API costs
3. Never commit API keys to the repository
4. Use environment variables for testing

## Common Development Tasks

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
black custom_components/
isort custom_components/
```

### Type Checking

```bash
mypy custom_components/natural_automation_generator/
```

### Testing in Home Assistant

1. Copy the integration to your HA `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration through the UI
4. Test with your entities and scenarios

## Release Process

1. Update version in `manifest.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release PR
4. Tag the release after merging
5. Update HACS information if needed
